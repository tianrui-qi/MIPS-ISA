# MIPS Processor in C

## Overview

We will implement a full gate-level circuit representing the datapath for a reduced, but still Turing complete, MIPS ISA. We first build all the basic component including logic gate, memory, control, ALU, decoder, adder, multiplexor, etc and then connect all of them by implementing a datapath.
